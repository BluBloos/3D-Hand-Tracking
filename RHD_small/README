CONTENT

This dataset provides 41258 training and 2728 testing samples. Each sample provides:
	- RGB image (320x320 pixels)
	- Depth map (320x320 pixels); See examples for how to convert the provided RGB
	- Segmentation masks (320x320 pixels) for the following classes: background, person, three classes for each finger and one for each palm
	- 21 Keypoints for each hand with their uv coordinates in the image frame, xyz coordinates in the world frame and an indicator if they are visible
	- Intrinsic Camera Matrix K
It was created with freely available character from www.mixamo.com and rendered with www.blender.org
For more details see the aforementioned paper.

Keypoints available:
0: left wrist, 1-4: left thumb [tip to palm], 5-8: left index, ..., 17-20: left pinky,
21: right wrist, 22-25: right thumb, ..., 38-41: right pinky

Segmentation masks available:
0: background, 1: person, 
2-4: left thumb [tip to palm], 5-7: left index, ..., 14-16: left pinky, 17: palm, 
18-20: right thumb, ..., right palm: 33

HOW TO USE

The dataset ships with minimal examples, that browse the dataset and show samples.
There is one example for Phython and one for MATLAB users; Their functionality is identical.
Both files are located in the root folder.

_______
STRUCTURE

./ 			: Root folder
./view_samples.m	: Script that shows basic use of the data for MATLAB
./view_samples.py	: Script that shows basic use of the data for Python
./evaluation/		: Contains the split used for evaluation of our algorithm
./evaluation/anno_training.mat		: Data structure for MATLAB use containing keypoint annotations and camera matrices K
./evaluation/anno_training.pickle	: Data structure for Python use containing keypoint annotations and camera matrices K
./evaluation/color/	: Color images
./evaluation/depth/	: 16bit Depth maps, where the 8 top bits are stored in red and the lower 8 bits are stored in green channel
./evaluation/mask/	: Segmentation masks
./training/		: Contains the split used for training of our algorithm (subfolders identical to ./evaluation/)

_______
CHANGELOG

version 1.1
  - There was a rounding/casting problem, which led to values of the images to be off by one every now and then compared to the version used in the paper. The difference is visually not noticable and not large, but it prevents from reaching the reported numbers exactly.
  - There were two minor bugs in view_samples.m. Thank you Franziska Mueller for reporting them.
